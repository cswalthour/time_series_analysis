# time_series_analysis
Analysis and methodology involving time series analysis that involves the following, but is not limited to:

* STL Decomposition
* Ratio of Seasonal Component siginificance
* Time Series Characterics feature-engineering (skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation, etc.)
* Smoothness using lag-1 autocorrelation

The end goal of above time series feature engineering is to expose informative data points about significance of seasonal influence evident within raw time series.
